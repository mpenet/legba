/!\ WIP: Here be dragons, it's not finished (but it's close).

*Legba* is a library aimed at building **fully OpenApi 3.1 compliant** services
in Clojure.

It leverages
[networknt/json-schema-validator](https://github.com/networknt/json-schema-validator)
for the schema validation part, ensuring **[complete and up-to-date spec
compliance](https://www.creekservice.org/json-schema-validation-comparison/functional)**,
not to mention **[great
performance](https://www.creekservice.org/json-schema-validation-comparison/performance)**.

*Legba* works by allowing you to construct a RING handler from an openapi json
file, that handler will be aware of the routing necesary and perform all the
checks that you specified via the openapi file provided .

Requests **and** Responses will be validated fully against the schema, covering
all aspects of the spec such as body contents, path parameters, query-string
parameters, headers, status codes, etc... Upon errors it will return an error
message with details about the failure and part of the schema concerned.

What it doesn't aim to do (at this time):

* Coercing payloads (ex: uuids, they get validated but you get a string)

* Supporting other means of validation, it's intentionally limited by what
  json-schema allows you to express and is agnostic of any clojure specific
  validation framework.
  
## Installation 

For now it's tools.deps only until an alpha is out.

```clj 
com.s-exp/legba {:git/url "https://github.com/mpenet/legba.git" :git/sha "..."}
```

## Usage 

``` clj
(require '[s-exp.legba :as l])

(l/openapi-handler {[:get "/item/{itemId}"]
                    (fn [_request]
                      {...})
                    [:get "/items"]
                    (fn [_request]
                      {...})
                    [:get "/search"]
                    (fn [_request]
                      {...})
                    [:post "/items"]
                    (fn [_request]
                      {..})}
                   ;; path to a resource file
                   :schema "schema/oas/3.1/catalog.json")
```

There's also an extra argument with options:

* `:not-found-response` - defaults to `{:status 404 :body "Not found"}`

* `:key-fn` - Control map keys decoding when turning jackson JsonNodes to clj
  data for the handler - default to `keyword`
  
* `:query-string-params-key` - where to find the decoded query-string
  parameters - defaults to `:params`
  
* `:validation-result` - function that controls how to turn
  `com.networknt.schema.ValidationResult` into a clj -> json response. Defaults
  to `s-exp.legba.schema/validation-result`
  
* `:extra-routes` - extra routes to be passed to the underlying reitit router
  (using `{:syntax :bracket}`)
  
  
### Notes

You don't have to do any JSON marshaling, if the content-type is
application/json we will read data as such, same goes for writing. Given the
validation library needs the data to be parsed, we preserve this work and re-use
the parsed content as much as possible. networknt/json-schema-validator relies
heavily on Jackson, so we re-use facilites provided by it.

Currently routing is performed via reitit, but we don't want to tie ourselves to
it longer term, so that might change eventually.
